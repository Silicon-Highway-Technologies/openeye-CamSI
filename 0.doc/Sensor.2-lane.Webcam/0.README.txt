Lukas Henkel:
   Our image sensor is packaged in a BGA package with
   a total height close to 1mm, not a bare die. On a bare
   die assembly the image plane sits about 150um above the
   board level. The BGA image sensor does not fit under the
   low-profile lens I have here. I have searched a bit more
   and found a lens that should work for testing. It´s only
   US$15 a piece, I´ll order some for the bringup and switch
   to the custom low profile lense holder once everything
   works, or see if I can find bare die sensors in the meantime
