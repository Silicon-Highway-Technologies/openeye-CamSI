Lukas Henkel (July 4, 2024):
   Our image sensor is packaged in a BGA package with
   a total height close to 1mm, not a bare die. On a bare
   die assembly the image plane sits about 150um above the
   board level. The BGA image sensor does not fit under the
   low-profile lens I have here. I have searched a bit more
   and found a lens that should work for testing. It´s only
   US$15 a piece, I´ll order some for the bringup and switch
   to the custom low profile lense holder once everything
   works, or see if I can find bare die sensors in the meantime

   I´m testing the mechanical integration of this lense
     https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/1-6-3mp-2-5mm-M5_62306174599.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.normal_offer.d_title.431413a0rhClmi

   The alignment pins do not quite fit the holes on the board, but a scalpel and a drop of UV or super glue will do the trick for testing.
